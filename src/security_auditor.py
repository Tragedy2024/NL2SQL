"""
Security Auditor Agent — LangGraph orchestration for the 4-Agent NL2SQL pipeline.

Per v1-implementation-report.md §0.2-0.6:
  - SecurityAwareNL2SQLState: global state flowing through the graph
  - build_security_aware_graph(): 4-Agent StateGraph with conditional routing
  - build_mac_sql_baseline_graph(): 3-Agent baseline (B1, no Security Auditor)
  - security_auditor_agent_node(): ★ core contribution — zero LLM calls
  - route_after_audit(): conditional routing based on degradation level

Architecture:
    Selector → Decomposer → Security Auditor → conditional → Refiner / END
    (LLM×1)    (LLM×1)      (★ LLM×0!)          ┌─ "continue" → Refiner
                                                  ├─ "degrade" → END (L1/L2)
                                                  └─ "reject"  → END (L3)

The Security Auditor Agent can be inserted into any LangGraph multi-Agent
NL2SQL pipeline. It sits between the Decomposer and any downstream consumer.
